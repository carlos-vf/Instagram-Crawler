For accessing Instagram account's info, you must be logged in Instagram, but not necessarily in the account you want to explore. You will be able to acces data from the profile you are logging in, as well as the accounts that profile follows.

Data firstly shown is refered to the profile you logged in with. If you want to see other profile details, click on "See Another Account Details".

If you want to check the people who do not follow you back, click on "Get Unfollowers".


## Notes

### Disclaimer
Do not abuse of the app by sending plenty of requests. Instagram can interpretate that as unusual activity and restrict temporaly or permanently your account.

If you can not log in into you account or an error occurs after that, it is probably due to Instagram requiring you a 2FA authentication. Log into your account in your browser and try again.
